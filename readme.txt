This is (will be) the Ell-i version of the Arduino IDE.  Eventually we
hope to both push everything upstream and package as a separate
library.  However, it appears easiest to start by forking and building
the Ell-duino environment inside the fork.

For the original readme file, see readme.arduino.txt.
